## Repository Structure

- `/Data`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `/Data Drift Results`: Includes HTML reports from the Evidently AI data drift analysis.
- `/Test Suite Results`: Contains the outcomes from various data quality tests.
- `Data_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`: The colab notebook with the code to perform all the analysis.

## Running the Analysis on Google Colab

To run the analysis:

1. Visit the Google Colab website.
2. Click on 'File' > 'Open notebook' > 'GitHub' tab.
3. Enter the URL of this GitHub repository and select the `Data_Quality_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Google Colab will then open the notebook, and you can run it cell by cell.

Note: Ensure that your Google Colab session has the necessary permissions to access the datasets and run the analysis.

## Results Interpretation

- Navigate to the `/Data Drift Results` directory to view an interactive HTML report detailing the data drift detected in the dataset.
- The `/Test Suite Results` directory to view an interactive HTML report that provides a comprehensive report on the data quality evaluation.
